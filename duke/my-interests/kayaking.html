    <h1>My Interest for Kayaking</h1>

    <p>This past summer (summer of 2024) I bought myself a used kayak. I have wanted one for a while and I finally pulled the trigger. It was the most fun I have had in a while. Exploring the lakes and rivers near me, driving 2.5 hours to a very chilly mountain lake, and even taking it camping with me! I would bring along a beer and my book and sit out on the water reading and soaking up the sun.</p>
