            <p>Hey there! Thanks for stopping by. My name is Jett Duke and this is the begining of my portfolio page. I am currently a project manager and scrum master for Providence Health and Services. I have been there since 2021. I am just starting my journey of learning html and am excited to add more projects here in the future. <br> Stay cool.</p>
