    <h1>My Best Friend Roso</h1>

    <p><img src="images/roso-small.jpg" alt="cute picture of roso"></p>

    <p>This is my best friend Roso. He is a 9.5 year old Basenji mix. I got him on my 18th birthday when my dad finally gave in and agreed to let me get a dog. That day is still crystal clear in my memory. We went to the Seatlle Humane Society and Roso was the first dog that I saw. We immediatly connected. He was laying on his bed with his head on his paws and when we made eye contact he immediatly perked up and I knew he was the one that would be coming home with me.</p>

    <p>He is a very stubborn man and is very proctective of me, but once he warms up to you he is a sweetheart. We love to go on long walks, hikes, and even camping together. This page would go on forever if I included all my favorite photos of him.</p>
